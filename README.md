# Maya-Image-Database-TWKM-...
Metadataschema + Import- + Edit-Scripts for our (Coneda)Kor_database
The Metadata schema, import-excels, importscripts for entities and relationships for our Image Database are stored here. 
The import scripts are created as workaround to mass ingest data 
from our excel tables into our conedakor web database. 
We provide one ruby-script which comprises all scripts for hepling to import the Entities, Properties and Relations, that can be found in the excel-source-Files. 
Also an export csv-file of the export from the given data within the ConedaKOR Database is given.
